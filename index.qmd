## Course Deliverable — Kellerwald Network Design Project

### Course objective

Throughout this course you will learn how to **design, analyse, and evaluate a spatially explicit hydrological monitoring network**.  
Your overarching goal is to develop a *reproducible and defensible rain-gauge network concept* for the Kellerwald region (~200 km²).  
This is not a purely technical mapping task, but a research-oriented design challenge that connects spatial reasoning, remote-sensing data, and hydrological process understanding.

The project evolves in three conceptual phases:

1. **Exploration** – Identify what makes a precipitation network “good” or “bad”, and define what “optimal” could mean in this context.  
2. **Development** – Apply methods learned in class (Kriging, radar bias correction, RS integration, uncertainty analysis) to iteratively refine your network.  
3. **Synthesis** – Present and defend a transparent, reproducible network design that links rainfall monitoring to hydrological response at sub-catchment scale.

### Final deliverables

At the end of the course each group submits **three complementary products**:

#### 1. Transparent repository (core submission)
A public or shared repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, or institutional server) that contains:
- All data sources, scripts, and documentation used to derive your final network.  
- A reproducible workflow that shows how you went from raw data to station selection and evaluation.  
- Clear version control and short README explaining structure and logic.  
The repository represents the **traceable backbone** of your project and demonstrates reproducibility and collaboration.

#### 2. Poster 
A concise visual summary of:
- The final proposed network (map and rationale).  
- The main methodological steps (e.g. interpolation, uncertainty analysis).  
- Key results or validation indicators.  
- A short reflection on limitations and future improvement.  
The poster must communicate the project as if presented at a professional hydrology or GIS conference.

#### 3. Five-minute pitch (presentation)
Each group presents their poster in a short oral pitch (max 5 min).  
The goal is to **argue convincingly** why your design is optimal *for its chosen criteria* (coverage, efficiency, hydrological adequacy).  
The pitch should demonstrate technical understanding, critical reasoning, and teamwork.

### Evaluation criteria (final synthesis)

Each submission is evaluated across **five dimensions**, 0–2 points each (max 10 pts):

| Criterion | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|------------|---|---|---|
| **Spatial reasoning** | arbitrary placement | partial coverage of key gradients | systematic physiographic logic (Luv–Lee, elevation, forest density) |
| **Hydrological integration** | no link to runoff | implicit link to subcatchments | explicit precipitation–discharge coupling and closure logic |
| **Methodological rigour** | ad-hoc reasoning | partial quantitative justification | reproducible workflow using kriging, RS, or uncertainty metrics |
| **Transparency & reproducibility** | no documentation | partial scripts / missing metadata | complete, documented, and reproducible repository |
| **Communication quality** | unclear poster / pitch | partially coherent argument | clear, concise, and scientifically convincing presentation |

---

### Competition element

The Kellerwald Network Design Project is structured as a **friendly competition**:  
the group achieving the highest total score becomes the *Course Design Champion*.  
In case of a tie, the tiebreaker is **Hydrological integration**, since the final goal is a coherent rainfall–runoff framework, not aesthetic map design.

### Learning outcome

By completing the full project you will be able to:
- Formulate and test design hypotheses for spatial monitoring networks.  
- Apply geostatistical, RS, and modelling tools to evaluate network performance.  
- Document and communicate your workflow transparently.  
- Defend a reasoned, evidence-based concept of “optimality” in hydrological monitoring.
