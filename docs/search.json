    "text": "Background and problem definition\nEstablishing a rain-gauge network in a complex forested upland such as the Kellerwald requires a clear understanding of how and why existing research catchments have organised their precipitation measurements. Gauge placement reflects climatic gradients, topographic controls, data uncertainty, and the need to link rainfall to hydrological response. To develop a robust concept for a new monitoring design, it is essential to study how benchmark field experiments have balanced spatial representativeness, measurement efficiency, and hydrological relevance.\n\nSelection and validation of reference sites\nThe five case studies were selected to represent well-documented hydrological observatories that combine long-term operation with explicit methodological transparency. Together they cover a broad spectrum of climatic regimes (arid to humid), land cover (semi-desert shrubland to temperate forest), and network-design philosophies (physiographic, statistical, and hydrological rationales). Each site provides publicly accessible metadata, peer-reviewed documentation, and a traceable evolution of its instrumentation, which allows the why and where of station deployment to be reconstructed rather than inferred.\nIn general, such selections are validated by three criteria:\n\nContinuity and data quality – multi-decadal, quality-controlled precipitation (and discharge) records are available.\n\nExplicit methodological reporting – publications or technical reports describe the logic or adjustment of station placement.\n\nScientific influence and reproducibility – the site serves as a benchmark or reference in later network-design or model-validation studies.\n\nThis combination reflects both the state of the art in network optimisation and the historical evolution of hydrological monitoring practice—from empirically grown catchments (Walnut Gulch, Reynolds Creek) to analytically optimised modern systems (HYREX, CAOS, Henriksen 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructor notes — Selection and validation of reference sites\n\n\n\nPurpose\nProvide an explicit rationale for choosing benchmark catchments that reflect historical practice and current methodological standards in precipitation-network design.\nSelection logic\n- Long-term, quality-controlled hydro-meteorological data (&gt;10 years).\n- Explicit documentation of why and where gauges were deployed (peer-reviewed papers or technical reports).\n- Representativeness across climatic and physiographic settings (arid–humid, lowland–upland, forested–open).\n- Demonstrated influence in later modelling or network-optimisation studies.\nValidation\nCombine empirical heritage (Walnut Gulch, Reynolds Creek) with analytical optimisation (HYREX, CAOS, Henriksen 2024) to cover state-of-the-art and historical evolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructor notes — Common pitfalls in selecting reference networks\n\n\n\nTypical mistakes\n- Using short-term campaigns (&lt; 2 years) without continuity or QC.\n- Choosing networks without metadata; if siting rationale or maintenance history cannot be reconstructed, comparisons lose value.\n- Relying on model-derived “virtual stations” instead of physical gauge networks.\n- Ignoring physiographic context (e.g., urban/agricultural networks as proxies for forested uplands).\n- Assuming modern equals better; some historical observatories remain superior due to documentation and consistency.\nReminder\nA benchmark network should be traceable, representative, and reproducible—not merely new or data-rich.",

    "section": "Hierarchy of deployment rationales",
    "text": "Hierarchy of deployment rationales\nAcross the benchmark catchments in the table, deployment rationales follow a hierarchical, not equal, structure. At the upper structural level, physiographic stratification defines the spatial framework of the network. This principle is explicit in Reynolds Creek and Attert/CAOS, where gauges were distributed along dominant gradients of elevation, geology, and land cover to guarantee structural representativeness before any statistical optimisation.\nAt the intermediate analytical level, information-gain optimisation refines density and placement within those strata. This rationale is most evident in HYREX (Brue Catchment) and Henriksen et al. 2024, where new gauges were allocated according to the marginal reduction of kriging variance or radar–gauge residuals under explicit budget constraints. The network evolves adaptively, responding to measured or modelled uncertainty rather than to fixed geometry.\nAt the lowest functional level, hydrological coupling links the precipitation network to discharge response. This coupling guided Walnut Gulch, where each ephemeral drainage required at least one gauge to translate storm rainfall into local runoff volumes. Modern frameworks couple this validation loop with statistical optimisation: unsatisfactory P→Q coherence or water-balance residuals trigger iterative refinement of both gauge density and stratification boundaries.\nSummary of the hierarchy\n- Physiographic stratification — structural representativeness (Reynolds Creek, Attert/CAOS).\n- Information-gain optimisation — analytical efficiency (HYREX, Henriksen 2024).\n- Hydrological coupling — functional adequacy (Walnut Gulch).",
