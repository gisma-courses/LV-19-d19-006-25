## Distance and data representation

Let's take a closer look at proximity, which is mentioned frequently.
What exactly is it? How can proximity/neighborliness be expressed in
such a way that the space becomes meaningful?

In general, spatial relationships are described in terms of
neighborhoods (positional) and distances (metric). In spatial analysis
or prediction, however, it is important to be able to name the spatial
**influence**, i.e. the evaluation or weighting of this relationship,
either qualitatively or quantitatively. Tobler did this for a specific
objective by stating that "near" is more important than "far". But what
about in other cases? The challenge is that spatial influence can only
be measured directly in exceptional cases. There are many ways to
estimate it, however.

### Neighborhood

Neighborhood is perhaps the most important concept. Higher dimensional
geo-objects can be considered neighboring if they *touch* each other,
e.g. neighboring countries. For zero-dimensional objects (points), the
most common approach is to use distance in combination with a number of
points to determine neighborhood.

### Distance

Proximity or neighborhood analyses are often concerned with areas of
influence or catchment areas, i.e. spatial patterns of effects or
processes.

This section discusses some methods for calculating distances between
spatial objects. Because of the different ways of discretizing space, we
must make the -- already familiar -- distinction between vector and
raster data models.

Initially, it is often useful to work without spatially restrictive
conditions in a first analysis, e.g. when this information is missing.
The term "proximity" inherently implies a certain imprecision.
Qualitative terms that can be used for this are: "near", "far" or "in
the neighborhood of". Representation and data-driven analysis require
these terms to be objectified and operationalized. So, this metric must
be based on a distance concept, e.g. Euclidean distance or travel times.
In a second interpretative step, we must decide which units define this
type of proximity. In terms of the objective of a question, there are
only suitable and less-suitable measures; there is no correct or
incorrect. Therefore, it is critical to define a meaningful neighborhood
relationship for the objects under investigation.

## Filling spatial gaps

Now that we have learned the basic concepts of distance, neighborhood
and filling spatial gaps, let's take a look at interpolating or
predicting values in space.

For many decades, deterministic interpolation techniques ([inverse
distance
weighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting),
[nearest
neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search),
[kriging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging)) have been the most
popular spatial interpolation techniques. External drift kriging and
regression kriging, in particular, are fundamental techniques that use
[spatial
autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis#Spatial_auto-correlation)
and covariate information, i.e. sophisticated regression statistics.

Machine learning algorithms like random forest have become very popular
for spatial environmental prediction. One major reason for this is that
they are can take into account non-linear and complex relationships,
i.e. compensate for certain disadvantages that are present in the usual
regression methods.

## Proximity concepts

### Voronoi polygons -- dividing space geometrically

[Voronoi polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) (aka
Thiessen polygons) are an elementary method for geometrically
determining *proximity* or *neighborhoods*. Voronoi polygons (see figure
below) divide an area into regions that are closest to a given point in
a set of irregularly distributed points. In two dimensions, a Voronoi
polygon encompasses an area around a point, such that every spatial
point within the Voronoi polygon is closer to this point than to any
other point in the set. Such constructs can also be formed in higher
dimensions, giving rise to Voronoi polyhedra.

distributed points in space -- in this case, rain gauges in Switzerland.
The overlaid polygons are the corresponding Voronoi segments that define
the corresponding closest geometrical areas (gisma 2021)"</figcaption>

</figure>

Since Voronoi polygons correspond to an organizational principle
frequently observed in both nature (e.g. plant cells) and in the spatial
sciences (e.g. [central
places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_place_theory) , according
to Christaller), there are manifold possible applications. Two things
must be assumed, however: First, that nothing else is known about the
space between the sampled locations and, second, that the boundary line
between two samples is **incomplete idea**.

Voronoi polygons can also be used to delineate catchment areas of shops,
service facilities or wells, like in the example of the Soho cholera
outbreak. Please note that within a polygon, one of the spatial features
is isomorphic, i.e. the spatial features are identical.

But what if we know more about the spatial relationships of the
features? Let's have a look at some crucial concepts.

### Spatial interpolation of data

*Spatially interpolating* data points provides us with a modeled
quasi-continuous estimation of features under the corresponding
assumptions. But what is spatial interpolation? Essentially, this means
using known values to calculate neighboring values that are unknown.
Most of these techniques are among the most complex methods of spatial
analysis, so we will deliberately limit ourselves here to a basic
overview of the methods. Some of the best-known and common interpolation
methods found in spatial sciences are *nearest neighbor* *inverse
distance*, *spline interpolations*, *kriging*, and *regression methods*.

### Continously filling the gaps by interpolation

To get started, take a look at the following figure, which shows six
different interpolation methods to derive the spatial distribution of
precipitation in Switzerland (in addition to the overlaid Voronoi
tessellation).

(GAM) interpolation</figcaption>

</figure>

In the example of precipitation in Switzerland, the positions of the
weather stations are fixed and cannot be freely chosen.

When choosing an appropriate interpolation method, we need to pay
attention to several properties of the samples (distribution and
properties of the measurement points):

-   **Representativeness of measurement points:** The sample should
    represent the phenomenon being analyzed in all of its
    manifestations.
-   **Homogeneity of measurement points:** The spatial interdependence
    of the data is a very important basic requirement for further
    meaningful analysis.
-   **Spatial distribution of measurement points:** The spatial
    distribution is of great importance. It can be completely random,
    regular or clustered.
-   **Number of measurement points:** The number of measurement points
    depends on the phenomenon and the area. In most cases, the choice of
    sample size is subject to practical limitations.

What makes things even more complex is that these four factors --
representativeness, homogeneity, spatial distribution and size -- are
all interrelated. For example, a sample size of 5 measuring stations for
estimating precipitation for all of Switzerland is hardly meaningful and
therefore not representative. Equally unrepresentative would be
selecting every measuring station in German-speaking Switzerland to
estimate precipitation for the entire country. In this case, the number
alone might be sufficient, but the spatial distribution would not be. If
we select every station at an altitude below 750 m asl, the sample could
be correct in terms of both size and spatial distribution, but the
phenomenon is not homogeneously represented in the sample. An estimate
based on this sample would be clearly distorted, especially in areas
above 750 m asl. In practice, virtually every natural
spatially-continuous phenomenon is governed by stochastic fluctuations,
so, mathematically speaking, it can only be described in approximate
terms.

### Machine learning

Machine learning (ML) methods such as random forest can also produce
spatial and temporal predictions (i.e. produce maps from point
observations). These methods are particularly robust because they take
spatial autocorrelation into account, which can improve predictions or
interpolations by adding geographic distances. This ultimately leads to
better maps with much more complex relationships and dependencies.

In the simplest case, the results are comparable to the well-known
model-based geostatistics. The advantage of ML methods over model-based
geostatistics, however, is that they make fewer assumptions, can take
non-linearities into account and are easier to automate.

<figcaption>The original dataset (top left) is a terrain model reduced
to 8 meters with 48384 single pixels. For interpolation, 1448 points
were randomly drawn and interpolated with conventional kriging (top
right), support vector machines (SVM) (middle left), neural networks
(middle right), and two variants of random forest (bottom row). In each
method, only the distance of the drawn points is used as a dependency.\

Each interpolation method was applied using the "default" settings.
Tuning could possibly lead to significant changes in all of them.
Fascinatingly, the error measures correlate to the visual results:
Kriging and the neural network show the best performance, followed by
the random forest models and the support-vector machine.
