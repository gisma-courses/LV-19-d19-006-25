## Exercises WS 4

1. Read the study area polygon from the `exdata/harz_borders.gpkg` file using the `read_sf()` function from the **sf** package.
2. Read the land cover raster data for Europe from the file `exdata/lc_europe.tif` using the function `rast()` from the package **terra**. Visualise both datasets.
2. Crop and mask the raster to the polygon boundaries. Visualise the results.
2. Compute a spatial signature for the study area. Can you understand its meaning?
2. Find out which areas of the Europe raster are most similar to the study area (this may take a minute or so). Try different window sizes (e.g. 200 or 500).
