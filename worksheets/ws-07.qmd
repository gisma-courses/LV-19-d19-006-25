Achieving reliable monitoring hinges on the reproducibility of both field data collection and subsequent analyses. In the context of spatial micro-scale analysis and modeling, the precise geo-object locations play a central role, presenting an additional challenge when considering the 3D structure. Incorporating the temporal aspect, such as accurately recording repeated flights, further elevates these demands. Whether utilizing low-cost or professional UAV systems, these factors must be acknowledged to enable meaningful analysis or modeling. While LiDAR systems are the preferred choice for acquiring forest structure, their high cost, both in acquisition and processing, poses challenges. A feasible alternative lies in off-the-shelf UAV systems with integrated image acquisition. These systems allow for the generation of not only orthorectified planar image data but also quasi-three-dimensional point clouds through photo reconstruction and image processing techniques, providing elevation information for each coordinate.
