## Exercises

The slides are accompanied by practical exercises.
The best way to get them is to download the exercises repository as a ZIP file from <https://github.com/gisma-courses/LV-19-d19-006-24/blob/main/assets/exercises-session1.zip> and unpack it on your computer.
Then, you can open the `.Rproj` file and start working on the exercises in RStudio.
