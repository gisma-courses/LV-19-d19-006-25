## Exercises WS 1

1. Read the data from `exdata/lc_small.tif` and visualize it. What is the location of the data? What are the extent of the data and its spatial resolution? How many categories it contains?
1. Calculate **Aggregation Index** (AI) for the raster. Interpret the results.
1. Calculate **Total Edge** (TE) for the raster. Interpret the results. Next, read the data from `exdata/lc_small2.tif, calculate AI and TE for this raster, and compare the results with the previous raster.
1. **Calculate Total Edge** (TE) for the raster, but this time in a *moving window* of 9 by 9 cells. Visualize the results.
1. (Extra) Using the `read_sf()` function from the **sf** package, read the `exdata/points.gpkg` file. Next, calculate SHDI and AI of an area of 3000 meters from each sampling point (see the `sample_lsm()` function).
