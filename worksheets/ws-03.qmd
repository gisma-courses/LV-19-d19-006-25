## Exercises WS 2

1. The marginal entropy and relative mutual information can be calculated using the **landscapemetrics** packageâ€™s functions: `lsm_l_ent()` and `lsm_l_relmutinf()`. Calculate both of these metrics for the `exdata/lc_small.tif` raster.
1. Read the `exdata/lc_europe.tif` raster using `rast()` from the **terra** package and the `exdata/polygons.gpkg` vector data using the `read_sf()` function from the **sf** package. Calculate the marginal entropy and relative mutual information for each polygon using the `sample_lsm()` function.
1. Join the calculated values with the polygons (see [https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/articles/irregular_areas.html](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/articles/irregular_areas.html) for more details).
1. Calculate SHDI and AI for the polygons. Compare the values of SHDI and AI with the marginal entropy and relative mutual information (e.g., using a scatterplot or by calculating the correlation coefficient). Are the results similar?
1. (Extra) Create your own polygonal grid using `st_make_grid()` function from the **sf** package for the area from the `exdata/polygons.gpkg` file. Calculate the marginal entropy and relative mutual information for each square using the `sample_lsm()` function. Visualize the results.
